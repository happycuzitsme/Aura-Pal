# Aura-Pal Frontend Architecture Guide

This manual simply breaks down the role and functions of the three core frontend files that make up the Aura-Pal Dashboard redesign. These files work together to generate the modern, responsive UI and hook into your physical robot backend.

## 1. `index.html` (Structure & Layout)
This is the root document that defines all of the visible building blocks and groups them into logical sections. 
- **The Container (`.container`)**: The app uses a full viewport layout containing absolutely positioned elements, moving away from standard scrolling document flow.
- **The Central Face (`#bigFace`)**: A group of simple `div` elements (eyes, mouth, decorations like tears and fumes) that rely entirely on CSS to dictate their shape. There are no images used for the face. The eyes (`.eye`) use a soft shadow instead of a border, and contain a modern, cute `.iris` element that shifts dynamically.
- **The Input Feeds (`.camera-area`)**: Contains the video placeholder, image uploading inputs, and mock ESP32 toggles overlayed compactly at the bottom left.
- **The Stats Panel (`.stats-area-wrapper`)**: A hidden slide-out drawer on the right edge. It houses the FER2013 percentage stat progress bars.
- **Quotation Box**: A simple box on the top right whose text node is targeted by Javascript to update dynamically.

## 2. `style.css` (Aesthetics & Animation)
This file is the engine behind the "modern cozy vibe" and all visual states.
- **CSS Variables `:root`**: At the very top, we define a pastel color palette and assign explicit colors for every single emotion (e.g. `--happy`, `--sad`) to maintain visual consistency everywhere.
- **Glassmorphism (`.glass-panel`)**: Uses semi-transparent background colors paired with `backdrop-filter: blur(16px)` to create the frosted glass effect on panels.
- **Face State Targeting**: The styling uses parent descendent selectors to dramatically alter the face layout based on what class is applied to the root face object. For example, applying `.face-sad` to the main container triggers CSS rules that shrink and tilt `.eye` and display `.tear`. 
- **Intensity Variables**: The CSS calculates the size, opacity, and animation speed of tiny decorations using variables like `--deco-scale` defined by the current intensity class (e.g. `.intensity-high`).
- **Idle Animators (`@keyframes`)**: Manages continuous CSS loops like the gradient background pulse (`bg-pulse`), the face bobbing (`idle-float`), and the emotion-specific particle emitters like anime marks throbbing (`throb`), bubbles floating (`bubble-float`), and tears dropping (`flow`).  

## 3. `script.js` (Logic & Interactivity)
This script sits on top of the HTML and CSS to simulate hardware backend data and manage DOM updates.
- **Emotion Mapping (`EMOTIONS`)**: A constant dictionary mapping the standard FER2013 output string (e.g. `"Happy"`) to the specific CSS class name (`"face-happy"`), UI colors, and a list of thematic quotations.
- **`updateEmotion()` Function**: The core workhorse function. When given an emotion name and confidence dictionary, it:
  1. Removes the previous emotion and intensity classes from the `#bigFace` container, forces a DOM reflow, and applies the new ones. This tells the CSS to trigger the transition animations and calculate decoration scaling.
  2. Updates all 7 progress bar widths in the right-side stats drawer.
  3. Fades the quotation box out, randomly selects a new quote array string, applies it, and fades it back in.
- **The Blink Loop**: Uses `setTimeout` to recursively append a `.blink` class to the `.eye` DOM elements at randomized 2 to 6-second intervals to give the face lifelike sentience.
- **Iris Tracking via Mouse**: The script tracks the cursor's coordinates (`mousemove`) relative to the center of each `.eye` and dynamically updates CSS variables (`--iris-x`, `--iris-y`) to let the `.iris` shift smoothly within the eye boundaries.
- **Mock Simulation Triggers**: Includes event listeners that attach to the UI buttons to spawn random mock emotion data payloads in intervals. *(See `integration_guide.md` on how to replace this with real WebSocket payloads.)*
